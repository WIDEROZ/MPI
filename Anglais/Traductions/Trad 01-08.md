### Progress and ethics
The world of science is boiling since we discovered the healing potential of basic cells. Studies have proven that doctors can cure of diseases like cancer or Parkinson thanks to theses precious cells. People find it in the spinal cord, the cord blood but also young fetus. The resort of young iced fetus from in vitro fertilisation (IVF) raise an ethical issue. Should we / humanity regard a three week fetus like a cluster of cells or a real human? 

Most western countries have trouble with the decision about the permission of a such practice. The advocates insist on the fact that our society can not pass by scientific progress while detractors asserts that the development can not be done ignoring the respect of life that these humans in being constitue. 

At the USA, that debate raging because most of the electors have the tendency to be pro-life advocates, which implies they confer to the fetus the human title in his entire part. By the way, George Bush have exercised his right of veto only one time during the two mandates : to forbid the basic cells research. Barack Obama, himself, seems to have a position much less inflexible than his predecessor. The Neo-conservatives will prevent yet maybe to cede to the pressure of the pharmaceutical industry which is impatient to launch in this newest doghouse.
