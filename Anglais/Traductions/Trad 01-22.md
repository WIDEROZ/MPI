Cloning techs which had already functioned on the animals are difficult to apply at the human specie. In 2013, an american team succeed to clone a human embryo over 
the blastocyst stade, but it never led to the birth of a newborn. There is numbers of obstacles : anomalies during the embryo development, threats for the nice being of cloned individuals and low rate of success. Moreover, ethical concerns considerably breaks progress in this domain. While researchers had been able to create stem cells from adults cells thanks to IPS cells (lol), this led the human cloning practice at therapeutic aims, less pertinent.
