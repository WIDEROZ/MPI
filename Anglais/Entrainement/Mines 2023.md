### Thème
Irina have founded a pretext to get rid of her daughter and and drown her into the cheap wine and whisky. 
"Are you going to feel you alone? In August we work full hour straight
- Oh no! I've brought books. And I will help you at the restaurant
- There is no way. Here you are in holidays.
"

It was relaxing to be treated as a spoiled child. 

The vacation club which Jaques and Paulette managed it, stood on a tiny peninsula at the end of a long road. Paulette parked in front of the main building. Clarisse went down of the car. It was her sixth summer here. She felt at home. Jacques ran out of his office and squeeze her against him. 

"And here is the prettiest! You didn't change at all!" Paulette laugh. 
"I just told her the contrary"

Prescot, near Liverpool, is thought to be the site of the only Elizabethan-era indoor playhouse
outside London. The theatre opening there on July 15th, a timber-framed replica of a 17th-
century playhouse, is meant to have greater impact. The idea is for the Shakespeare North
Playhouse to become one corner of a theatrical triangle along with Stratford-on-Avon, where
the Royal Shakespeare Company has its base, and Shakespeare’s Globe theatre in London. The
venue is central to plans to revive Prescot, which is in one of the most deprived areas of Britain.
It is expected to bring in 140,000 visitors and add £5.4m ($6.4m) to the local economy each
year. Shakespeare-themed businesses are cropping up; a pub called 'The Bard’ now graces the
high street.
Under Boris Johnson, the government has been keen on using cultural attractions to advance its
'levelling up’ agenda, to reduce inequalities between the south-east and the rest of the country.
But when it comes to winning funding for projects, cultural institutions can be at a disadvantage.
As well as creating jobs and luring tourists, these venues claim many intangible benefits.
Melanie Lewis, the boss of the new theatre in Prescot, lists social activities to reduce loneliness
among the elderly, educational programmes for local children and, most unquantifiable of all,
enhanced pride in the city. Pricing such benefits is tricky, especially if admission is free (as it
is at most national museums). One technique is to ask people how much they would be willing
to pay for something. The answers can be used to assess what people get out of a cultural asset
and to test out hypothetical scenarios that might inform funding decisions.
In 2021 the government launched a multi-year research project into how to value the benefits
of culture and heritage. But the real constraint on new projects is limited budgets. Most arts
funding in England comes from local government; the bulk of the money to pay for the theatre
in Prescot was from local authorities. A wobbly economy, and a new prime minister who is less
wedded than Mr Johnson to the idea of levelling up, may mean fewer curtains going up. The
course of cultural regeneration never did run smooth.
